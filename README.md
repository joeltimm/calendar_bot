# Calendar Sync Bot

This is a Python-based Flask application designed to synchronize calendar events between specified Google Calendar accounts. It uses Google Calendar Push Notifications for real-time updates and includes a self-hosted health monitoring service with email alerts.

**Features:**
* **Advanced Event Handling:** Intelligently processes different event types:
    * **Clones Birthday Events:** Creates clean, shareable copies of read-only birthday events.
    * **Duplicates Gmail Events:** Duplicates events created automatically from Gmail (like flights or reservations) and adds a shared attendee.
    * **Invites Shared Calendar:** Adds a designated shared calendar to all other standard events.
* **Resilient by Design:**
    * **Automatic Retries:** Uses Tenacity to automatically retry failed Google API calls with exponential backoff.
    * **Stateful Memory:** Remembers which events have been processed to prevent duplicate actions, even after restarts.
    * **Self-Cleaning Memory:** A weekly scheduled job automatically cleans out old event IDs to keep the memory file efficient and prevent data corruption.
* **Comprehensive Monitoring:**
    * **Prometheus Exporter:** Exposes a rich set of metrics on a `/metrics` endpoint for performance and health monitoring.
    * **Uptime Kuma Integration:** Sends heartbeat pings to an Uptime Kuma "Push" monitor on every successful poll.
* **Dual-Trigger Operation:**
    * **Scheduled Polling:** Checks for new events on a regular, configurable interval.
    * **Webhook Ready:** Can be triggered instantly by Google Calendar Push Notifications for real-time processing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local server.

### Prerequisites

* A server with `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
* A Google Cloud Project with the Calendar API enabled.
* A SendGrid account for email notifications.
* (Optional) An Uptime Kuma instance for heartbeat monitoring.

### 1. Configuration

All configuration is handled through a `.env` file in the project root.

First, copy the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, edit the .env file and fill in your values.

### Google Cloud Project Setup

1.  Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project or use an existing one.
3.  Enable the **Google Calendar API**.
4.  Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    * Configure your consent screen, setting "User type" to "External" and setting the "Publishing status" to **"In production"**. (This is crucial for long-lived tokens).
    * Add the following OAuth scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` and (if using original Gmail sending via OAuth) `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`. Note that `gmail.send` requires verification for external apps. Your current setup uses SendGrid for emails, avoiding this sensitive scope for the main bot operation.
5.  Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    * Create **OAuth Client ID** credentials. Choose "Desktop app".
    * Download the JSON file. This file contains your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
    * **Rename this file** for clarity, e.g., `google_credentials_calendar1.json` or `calendar_credentials_calendar2.json`.
    * **Keep this file absolutely private.** It will be stored in a secure location on your server, *outside* your Git repository.

### Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

1.  Log in to your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2.  Navigate to **Zero Trust > Access > Tunnels**.
3.  **Create a new Tunnel.** Follow Cloudflare's instructions to generate and record your **Tunnel Token**. This token is highly sensitive.
4.  Configure a **Public Hostname** for your tunnel:
    * **Subdomain:** `calendarbot-webhook` (or your preferred subdomain)
    * **Domain:** Your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
    * **Service Type:** `HTTP`
    * **Service URL:** `http://calendar_bot:5000` (This is the internal Docker Compose service name and its internal container port).

### SendGrid Setup

1.  Sign up for a [SendGrid account](https://sendgrid.com/).
2.  Navigate to **Email API > Integration Guide** or **Settings > API Keys** to generate an **API Key**. This key is highly sensitive.
3.  Verify your Sender Identity (email address or domain) in SendGrid.

### Uptime Kuma Setup (Optional)

1.  If you have an [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) instance running:
2.  **Create a "Push" monitor** for your bot's main heartbeat. Copy the unique **Push URL** provided by Uptime Kuma (e.g., `https://your_uptime_kuma_instance.com/api/push/YOUR_PUSH_KEY`). This URL is sensitive.
3.  (Optional) Create an "HTTP(s) - Keyword" monitor to regularly ping your bot's public health endpoint: `https://calendarbot-webhook.yourdomain.com/health`. This monitor checks if your web service is responsive.

## 4. Secure Secrets Management

This section outlines how to manage your sensitive API keys and credentials securely, ensuring they are never committed to your public Git repository or stored in plaintext on your server.

### Create Secure Host Directory

Create a dedicated, private directory on your server to store all sensitive files. This directory should be outside your `calendar_bot` Git repository clone.
```bash
mkdir -p /home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/google_auth
```
**(Replace `/home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets` with your chosen secure absolute path on your server.)**

### Prepare Google Client Secrets

Move your downloaded Google OAuth Client ID JSON files into your secure host directory.
```bash
mv /path/to/your/downloaded/google_credentials_calendar1.json /home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/google_auth/
mv /path/to/your/downloaded/calendar_credentials_calendar2.json /home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/google_auth/
```
**(Replace paths with your actual downloaded file locations.)**

### Generate Encrypted Environment File

You will create a temporary plaintext `.env` file, encrypt it using your `encrypt_env.py` script, and then move the encrypted version to your secure host directory.

1.  **Create a temporary plaintext `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    nano .env.temp_plaintext
    ```
    Paste all your environment variables into this file. **Fill in your actual sensitive values.**
    ```ini
    # .env.temp_plaintext (TEMPORARY FILE - WILL BE DELETED AFTER ENCRYPTION)

    # --- Core Application Settings ---
    INVITE_EMAIL=your_invite_email@gmail.com
    PROCESSED_FILE=/app/data/processed_events.json
    POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5
    SOURCE_CALENDARS=calendar1@gmail.com,calendar2@gmail.com
    DEBUG_LOGGING=false
    GOOGLE_WEBHOOK_URL="[https://calendarbot-webhook.yourdomain.com](https://calendarbot-webhook.yourdomain.com)"

    # --- SendGrid Settings for Email Notifications ---
    SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email@yourdomain.com
    TO_EMAIL=your_alert_recipient@gmail.com
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.YOUR_ACTUAL_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE

    # --- Cloudflare Tunnel Token ---
    CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN_HERE

    # --- Uptime Kuma Monitoring (Outbound Push from bot) ---
    UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL="https://your_uptime_kuma_[instance.com/api/push/YOUR_PUSH_KEY](https://instance.com/api/push/YOUR_PUSH_KEY)"

    # --- Health Monitor Settings ---
    MONITOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60
    MONITOR_STATUS_FILE=/app/status/monitor_status.json
    ```
    **Save and close** this file.

2.  **Generate a strong encryption key (if you don't have one already):**
    ```bash
    python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
    ```
    **SAVE THIS KEY SECURELY.** This is your `DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. You will need to set it as an environment variable in your shell *every time* you run scripts that encrypt/decrypt or start Docker Compose.

3.  **Set `DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your current shell:**
    ```bash
    export DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_GENERATED_ENCRYPTION_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Encrypt the temporary `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    mv .env.temp_plaintext .env # Rename to .env for encrypt_env.py
    python3 encrypt_env.py
    ```

5.  **Immediately delete the plaintext `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    rm .env
    ```

6.  **Move the encrypted file to your secure host directory:**
    ```bash
    mv secrets/.env.encrypted.bak /home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/
    ```
    You can now safely remove the empty `secrets/` directory from your project root: `rmdir secrets`.

### Generate Google OAuth2 Tokens

Your Google OAuth2 tokens (`token_calendar1.json`, `token_calendar2.json`) are generated by scripts. These tokens are highly sensitive and must also reside in your secure host directory.

1.  **Modify `~/calendar_bot/scripts/generate_google_tokens.py`:**
    Update the `SECURE_GOOGLE_AUTH_HOST_PATH` variable within this script to point to your actual secure host directory (`/home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/google_auth`). This ensures the script saves the generated tokens to the correct, secure location.

    ```python
    # Example snippet from generate_google_tokens.py
    # ...
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # !!! IMPORTANT !!!
        # This path MUST point to your SECURE HOST LOCATION, NOT your Git repository!
        SECURE_GOOGLE_AUTH_HOST_PATH = Path("/home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/google_auth") # <--- REPLACE THIS PATH

        SERVICES = {
            "calendar1_google_access": {
                "client_secrets_filename": SECURE_GOOGLE_AUTH_HOST_PATH / "google_credentials_calendar1.json",
                "token_filename": SECURE_GOOGLE_AUTH_HOST_PATH / "token_calendar1.json",
                "scopes": [
                    "[https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send)",
                    "[https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar)"
                ]
            },
            "calendar_calendar2": {
                "client_secrets_filename": SECURE_GOOGLE_AUTH_HOST_PATH / "calendar_credentials_calendar2.json",
                "token_filename": SECURE_GOOGLE_AUTH_HOST_PATH / "token_calendar2.json",
                "scopes": ["[https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar)"]
            }
        }
        # ... rest of the script
    ```

2.  **Run the token generation script:**
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/generate_google_tokens.py
    ```
    Follow the prompts to authorize your Google accounts. The generated `token_*.json` files will be saved directly to `/home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/google_auth/`.

## 5. Docker Compose Deployment

### Update Docker Compose File

Replace the content of your `~/calendar_bot/docker-compose.yml` with the following. **Remember to replace the placeholder paths with your actual secure host paths.**

```yaml
# ~/calendar_bot/docker-compose.yml (FINAL Public Repo Version)

services:
  calendar_bot:
    build: .
    container_name: calendar_bot-calendar_bot-1
    restart: unless-stopped

      - UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL=${UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL}
      - GOOGLE_WEBHOOK_URL=${GOOGLE_WEBHOOK_URL}
    ports:
      - "5001:5000" # Map host port 5001 to container port 5000
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      # Mount the secure host directory containing your ENCRYPTED .env.encrypted.bak
      # This file will be /home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/.env.encrypted.bak on your host

    external: true
    name: network_name
```

### Create Runtime Environment Loader

This script loads your environment variables into the shell from your encrypted file, then cleans up.

**Create `~/calendar_bot/load_runtime_env.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/calendar_bot/load_runtime_env.sh
#
# Decrypts the encrypted .env file, loads variables into the current shell environment,
# and then immediately deletes the temporary plaintext file.
#
# IMPORTANT: DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY must be set in your shell environment
#            before sourcing this script.
# Usage: source ./load_runtime_env.sh (or just . ./load_runtime_env.sh)

# --- Configuration ---
ENCRYPTED_FILE="/home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets/.env.encrypted.bak" # <-- REPLACE THIS HOST PATH
TEMP_PLAINTEXT_FILE="./.env.temp_load" # Temporary plaintext file in project root

# --- Check for encryption key ---
if [ -z "$DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY is not set in your environment."
  echo "Please run: export DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY=\"your_key_here\""
  exit 1
fi

# --- Decrypt to temporary file ---
python3 decrypt_env.py "$ENCRYPTED_FILE" > "$TEMP_PLAINTEXT_FILE"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Decryption failed. Aborting."
  rm -f "$TEMP_PLAINTEXT_FILE" # Clean up temp file on failure
  exit 1
fi

# --- Load variables into current shell ---
# The 'set -a' exports all subsequent variables.
# The 'set +a' turns it off.
# This ensures all variables from the decrypted file are exported.
set -a
source "$TEMP_PLAINTEXT_FILE"
set +a

# --- Clean up temporary plaintext file ---
rm "$TEMP_PLAINTEXT_FILE"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Failed to delete temporary plaintext file: $TEMP_PLAINTEXT_FILE"
fi

echo "✅ Environment variables loaded into current shell session."
```

###📊 Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

The bot is a fully instrumented Prometheus target, exposing metrics at the /metrics endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:5000/metrics).

Key Metrics Exposed

Metric Name	Type	Labels	Description
calendar_bot_polls_initiated_total	Counter	-	Total number of polling cycles started.
calendar_bot_poll_duration_seconds	Histogram	-	Tracks the time taken to complete a polling cycle. Great for performance monitoring.
calendar_bot_processed_event_ids_count	Gauge	-	The current number of event IDs stored in the bot's memory file.
calendar_bot_events_cleaned_total	Counter	-	Total number of old event IDs removed by the weekly self-cleaning job.
calendar_bot_events_processed_success_total	Counter	calendar_id, event_type	Counts successfully processed events, categorized by calendar and processing type (e.g., birthday_clone, invite_added).
calendar_bot_events_processed_failure_total	Counter	calendar_id, reason	Counts failed event processing attempts, categorized by calendar and failure reason (e.g., api_http_error).
calendar_bot_webhooks_received_total	Counter	-	Total number of inbound webhooks received from Google.

You can add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana and build a custom dashboard to visualize these metrics and monitor the health and performance of your bot.

### Build and Run Services

1.  **Set `DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your shell (if not already in your `.bashrc`):**
    ```bash
    export DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_GENERATED_ENCRYPTION_KEY_HERE"
    ```

2.  **Load runtime environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/calendar_bot
    source ./load_runtime_env.sh
    ```

3.  **Build and run your Docker services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down # Stop and remove any old containers
    docker-compose up --build -d # Build new images and start services in detached mode
    ```

---

## 6. Verification

* **Check Docker container status:** `docker ps` (all services should be `Up` and `healthy`).
* **Monitor logs:** `docker-compose logs -f` (look for "Webhook successfully established/renewed", "Sent successful heartbeat to Uptime Kuma").
* **Test webhook:** Create a new event in your Google Calendar and observe `calendar_bot` logs for "Webhook received!".
* **Check Uptime Kuma:** Verify your monitors are reporting correctly.

---

## 7. Ongoing Maintenance

* **Token Renewal:** Your bot automatically refreshes Google OAuth2 tokens. If a refresh token becomes invalid (e.g., after a long period of inactivity or if revoked), you will need to manually re-run `python3 scripts/generate_google_tokens.py`.
* **Log Monitoring:** Regularly check `docker-compose logs -f` or your configured log storage.
* **Uptime Kuma Alerts:** Ensure Uptime Kuma is configured to notify you of downtime.
* **Security:** Keep your `DOTENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the `/home/${USER}/my_super_secure_secrets` directory absolutely secure.
